# Custom Linear and Logistic Regression implementation

Working linear and logistic regression models are present in the jupyter notebook files.


We implementing a linear regression model with our own gradient descent module on example data ( ex1data1.mat).
- Then we calculate the parameters (a, b) in a line function y = ax+b via linear regression model.
- Finally we will plot the output line and the input data in the same figure. Plot the cost curve.
